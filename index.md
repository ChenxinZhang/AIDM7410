# The Change of Chinese Female Image in about the Past 20 Years -- Summarized by study 742 Women Magazine Covers

​		In recent years, discussions on women’s topics have been unprecedentedly high. Popular female variety shows such as Sisters Who Waves，Listen to me have emerged one after another, and women's topics have also been frequently searched.#How great an actress can speak , #Sister stand up and other hot searches are behind the awakening of women’s independence and self-improvement.

​		The evolution of female images is closely related to China's ever-changing social background and culture. The changes in the image of women have become a mirror of the development of the times, reflecting China's social changes and the evolution of cultural concepts. The visual symbols in the magazine record the changes in the image of women, and different types of magazines describe the various modes of shaping the image of women in society. By analyzing the evolution of women's beauty in different magazines, we can observe the development of society's standards for women's images and women's beauty.

​		"The prevalence of girl culture shows that men are not confident"-Tao Hong

 

​		"I think wrinkles have something to do with youth, not beauty."-Yu Feihong

 

​		"I actually don't really like the term professional women. Why doesn't anyone say professional men?"-Yao Chen

​		In modern times, women are more and more daring to criticize "white, young and thin" and other abnormal aesthetics, and face up to and appreciate the maturity and experience brought by age. Although gender stereotypes still exist in life, more and more women have embraced the idea of gender equality, holding up the banner of refusal to menstrual shame and refusal to sell body anxiety.

​		However, more than a decade ago, the public opinion faced by women was very different from today.

​		"Are you a man's luxury or daily necessities?"

 

​		"Why don't men marry me?"

 

​		"Welcome to the "Leftover Women Era""

​		……

​		In order to understand the changes in the social and public opinion environment that women live in over time, we selected three different types of Chinese magazines For Him Magazine, COSMO and WOMEN OF CHINA as the analysis objects. Research on the female image on the cover of the magazine and explore the shaping and construction of the female image by male business magazines, female fashion magazines, and national publications.

​		FHM is a men's fashion magazine launched by the Fashion Group in 2004. As a "Men's True Feeling Magazine", it is famous for its bold and naked female images. COSMO is a women's fashion magazine that entered the mainland market in 1993 and has the title of one of the top five fashion magazines in mainland China. The commercial nature of these two magazines has become a window through which we try to pry into the image of women we expect from the audience's perspective. WOMEN OF CHINA as a national-level journal launched by the All-China Women’s Federation, the audience is Chinese women at home and abroad, and its propaganda nature makes it a sample of society’s expectations of Chinese women. The cover of the magazine is like a vivid history book, helping us to explore the changes in people's understanding and perspective of women over the past two decades.

​		We collected a total of 741 magazines, including 155 copies of FHM (197 after screening), 369 copies of COSMO, and 231 copies of WOMEN OF CHINA. We only selected the magazines with women on the cover, and after screening 741 magazines, 684 were left. Among them, the time span of FHM and COSMO is from 2004 to the present, and the WOMEN OF CHINA is from 2001 to the present. The pictures are all from public websites, but a few are missing. We use a combination of computer and human methods for data processing, computer methods for color analysis and text recognition on pictures, and human coding for the extraction of female character features. A total of three coders were cross-validated. All the computer codes and man-made coding tables used can be found in the supporting files.

**For Him Magazine: Body becomes a symbol**




​		We collected 197 FHM (China) covers featuring women since the magazine's inception in 2004 to analyze how women's images have changed in men's magazines over the past 20 years.
<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/peopleofforhimmagazine.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = center>

**What kind of woman is in a men's magazine?** 

​		Through manual coding and statistics of magazine covers, we find that over 70% of cover girls are showbiz stars, such as Fan Bingbing, Li Bingbing, Zhou Xun, etc., who are successful in their career and beautiful in shape. They have appeared on the cover of FHM for many times, showing their beautiful faces and bodies in the cover.

 
<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/Areas%20of%20FHM%20Cover%20Figure.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = center>



​		Most of the cover figures we have collected are from the Chinese mainland, but some are showbiz stars from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas.

​		Among the non-celebrities, there are a number of emerging models from the “Dress Girl Dream Show” and other modeling competitions. According to BaiduPedia, the "Dress Girl Dream Show" is a series of activities with the theme of "Chinese Style Sexy" held by the FHM since 2008, in an effort to explore their own aesthetic standards for Chinese men and select models and actors who meet the magazine's standards of "Chinese Style Sexy". Although the girls are not showbiz stars, they are seen as aesthetic symbols for Chinese men, graced the cover of FHM.

​		Among the cover females whose ages can be found, 25- to 34-year-olds are the most common, depending on how old they were when the magazine published. These females tend to have been in the entertainment industry for many years, have achieved some kind of success in their career and are in the bonus period of the entertainment industry career. 

​		Among other age groups, the number of women between 18 and 24 ranks second. They are fresh blood in front of the camera, full of energy, ambition and courage to face future challenges. Liu Wen, 19, and Ju Xiaowen, 21, have both appeared on the cover of FHM.

<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/FHM%20Cover%20Figure%20Age.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = center>

​		Mature women aged 35-44 account for about 10 percent of all women in covers, and with the exception of Olympic champion Li Ying and fashion photographer Chen Man, all of them are entertainment stars. They are successful, well groomed, and graced the covers of the FHM, either elegant or sexy.

​		Although FHM is known for its sexy pictures, two underage girls have appeared on its cover: Feng Jing, who won the New Silk Road Model Contest at the age of 16, and Wen Qi, who won the Golden Horse Award for Best Supporting Actress at the age of 14.
<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/FHM%20Cover%20Figure%20Occupation.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = center>

​		Based on the occupations of cover females, we've compiled a list of 11 occupations that FHM presents to its readers. Most of the women on the cover are from the entertainment and fashion industries, with nearly 80 percent being actors, models and singers. Athletes ranked fourth in the list of cover characters. In addition to national taekwondo athlete Zhang Lanxin, who has already entered the film industry, and has been on the cover five times, others have made their names in Olympic histories, such as women's volleyball player Zhang Changning and "nine-ball queen" Pan Xiaoting.

​		In addition, seven streamers have appeared on the cover of FHM, including five on the cover of an annual special in 2016 titled "Sexy feast in live broadcasting era, 50 Most Beautiful Female Streamers"

​		Volunteer is a somewhat special presence in the occupation of cover figures. On May 12, 2008, Wenchuan, Sichuan Province, suffered an 8.0 magnitude earthquake. The cover of the July issue featured a female volunteer in a tent disaster relief area in Chengdu.

**How do women usually appear in men's magazines?**

​		Body language is a way of communication to convey thoughts and meanings. Through the external body features of characters such as posture and clothing, we can explore the status and role of women in men's magazines, so as to know what women are like in this men's world displayed by the FHM.

<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/FHM%20Cover%20Figure%20Portrait.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = center>

​		Women's clothing at For Him Magazine is very diverse. We coded it into 11 categories, of which Bikini was the most common, followed by one-piece underwear & swimwear, dress, hotpants & miniskirts. In general, the women on the covers are kind of naked and sexy, which is in line with the positioning of FHM as China's version of Playboy, showing men's feeling of the sexual attractiveness of women's bodies and attracting the attention of male readers.

​		Women on the covers are also in a variety of poses. We summarized five types: standing, sitting, lying, lying prone, and motion. Cover females show their good shape, and present a variety of formal beauty through different movements.

 
<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/forhimmagazine_example4.jpg?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = center>

**What are men's magazines talking about?**

​		On the cover of a magazine, the text revolves around the image of females on the cover, bringing the reader with visual stimulation. Studying the cover text of FHM can help us understand the thoughts and opinions the magazine is trying to express. We extracted the cover text of the FHM with female cover figures and did natural language processing. 

​		From the word cloud, it can be seen that the words Fashion, Sexy, Product, Equipment and so on appear many times in the cover, there are some commercial recommendations for male readers, such as Watches, Men's Clothing and so on, and words aimed at women mainly include Sexy, Girl, Girlfriend, Beauty.

 
<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/wordcloudofforhimmagazine.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = center>

​		In recent years, the FHM has changed in content and cover style, with less sexy shapes and some covers only featuring male images. In terms of the cover text, there appeared "She and herself", "new progressive me" and other slogans with the color of female independence instead of male perception. The cover of the December 2020 issue shows a group portrait of girls, with the caption "post-00s girls with the right to answer questions in their future", which is a big contrast with the previous style of looking at women from a man perspective.

**COSMO : Women who are "perfectly" shown**

​		COSMO is a women's fashion magazine that entered the mainland market in 1993 and has the title of one of the top five fashion magazines in mainland China.We collected 369 magazine covers with women appearing since 2004 to study the images of women in women’s business magazines.

​		As a fashion magazine for profit, COSMO is a fashion consumer magazine targeting young women and white-collar workers. It seems to be appearing next to female readers as a "best friend".In the fashion market divided by many magazines in China, what kind of spiritual and cultural exploration does COSMO offer women?

​		The cover design of a fashion magazine mainly consists of two parts of visual vocabulary.The expression of the visual theme of the cover and the content guide catalog together constitute the core of the cover of a fashion magazine. After researching the cover of COSMO magazine in mainland China for the past 20 years, we have got some findings.

​		We collected a total of 97 female cover characters from 369 magazines of COSMO in Mainland China from 2004 to 2021 as samples for our research and analysis.

​		We are curious about a magazine that has a strong appeal and influence on women’s fashion in the Chinese mainland market. For women’s fashion magazines, the cover image and shooting techniques will convey the core ideas of the magazine. Therefore how does the influential COSMO present the image of women? Is there a stereotyped impression of the construction of female images? What factors may influence the portrayal of women in a fashion magazine?

**Who can be on the cover of women's fashion magazines?**

​		We first choose to combine the characteristics of demographics to explore the data and visualization of the questions we are curious about through the two aspects of the cover woman's occupation, social role characteristics and age.

 
<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/people%20of%20cosmo.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = center>

 

​		Through the manual coding and visualization of 369 magazines of COSMO from 2001 to 2021, we can see that the top ten most frequently appearing characters on the cover in the past two decades are all from the entertainment industry.These women include Fan Bingbing, Zhao Wei, Yang Ying, Zhou Xun, Li Bingbing, Ni Ni, Li Yuchun, Gao Yuanyuan, etc. By searching these women, we found that they all have similar characteristics in a certain field. For example, they all have a high reputation and influence, conform to the public's aesthetic preferences and possess plastic tension.

​		We refer to the Forbes China Celebrity 100 and the audience's awareness of the stars themselves. We have observed that COSMO magazine has higher comprehensive requirements for cover women.This also means that they are very strict about the selection of cover characters. At the same time, the repeat exposure rate of cover women is also relatively high, especially concentrated on the well-known domestic actresses such as Zhao Wei, Zhou Xun, Yang Ying, Tang Yan, Fan Bingbing, etc.
<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/COSMO%20Cover%20FIgure%20Occupation.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = center>

​		We have divided the age groups four times to explore the age levels of the cover characters, which are 18 to 24 years old, 25 to 34 years old, 35 to 44 years old, and women over 45 years old. Through the above COSMO Cover Figure Age, we can clearly see that the women who have appeared in COSMO magazine on the cover of magazines for 20 years are mainly concentrated between 25 and 34 years old. More than 50% of the women in this age group appear on magazine covers, followed by women between 35 and 44. The age group of the cover characters of FHM is also mainly between 25 and 34 years old. The cover characters in this age group also exceed 50%, which is the largest proportion of all age groups.

 
<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/COSMO%20Cover%20Figure%20Age.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = center>

​		COSMO and FHM magazines tend to choose women from 25 to 34 years old as cover characters when choosing cover characters. This is also the main age group and bonus period of current fashion and entertainment stars. However we can also see that, compared with COSMO, FHM tends to be younger when choosing the age group of female cover characters. In the past two decades, there have been nearly twice as many women between the ages of 18 and 24 who have appeared on the cover of FHM than in COSMO.

​		In the [COSMO(SUCCESS+STYLE)](http://cn-library.rukomos.ru/shi_shang_cosmo_success_style_2015nian_1yue_kan_tao_zhuang_gong_2ce__115460-book_online.html) special book, it is mentioned that “using celebrities to talk about fashion and lifestyle attitude magazines, to realize the star dreams of white-collar women.” And for this purpose, using women between the ages of 25 and 34 as cover characters is more conducive to reflect the independent, confident and wonderful female image that the magazine hopes to promote.

**What are the characteristics of women on the cover of fashion magazines?**

 
<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/COSMO%20Cover%20Figure%20Portrait.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = center>

​		The feminine dress and hairstyle characteristics of a magazine cover character are the key to shaping the character's image, and clothing is an extension of the human skin. The dress and hairstyle of the woman on the cover are very important visual language, which not only reflects the character of the character, but also represents the values of the magazine itself.

​		When we made statistics on the portraits of the cover characters of COSMO we noticed that long hair, skirts and standing up to the camera are the most frequently used shots in this business women’s fashion magazine in the past two decades. The long hair and skirts are very typical to outline people’s traditional impression of women’s elegance and gentleness. We saw the cover of WOMEN OF CHINA also confirmed this. Different from the angle of women’s gaze, we found that FHM puts the purpose of "sexy" into the cover, and the cover characters of the magazine with bikinis and swimsuits as the main attire are openly showing their fire. The characters on the cover try to be sexy through more skin exposure and less clothing cover.

​		The introduction title of the cover character plays a vital role as a textual aid for the "blockbuster" shot by the magazine editorial department for a specific theme. The visual effects of the characters selected on the cover of the magazine are usually the photos that are considered to be the most representative of the theme, and the introduction title of the cover image represents the interpretation of the cover image by the editorial department and even the cover character itself. These words are also influencing and guiding readers.

​		In the COSMO, we observed that "love", "sexy", "youth", "beauty", and "happiness" are all high-frequency keywords that often appear in the cover lead title. In January 2015, August 2018 and August 2017 in COSMO, we can see "women in the workplace", "girls support girls", "pink power" and other women with self-consciousness and awakening. The vocabulary appears on the cover. The awakening of female consciousness expresses women's pursuit of equal rights in the political, economic, and cultural fields. In addition to fashionable clothes and exquisite makeup and hair, more and more women are beginning to focus on exploring their inner world, looking for an independent self in life. The use of these words also reflects the encouragement of a magazine focusing on women's fashion for women to publicize their attitudes to life and pursue self-independent personality.

**WOMEN OF CHINA**：**Female power during twenty years**

​		WOMEN OF CHINA is a national-level journal published by the China Women's Federation for Chinese female readers at home and abroad. We analyzed the covers of all 231 magazines that can be found on public websites during the two decades from 2001 to 2021, mainly from CNKI and the WeChat of WOMEN OF CHINA. And we tried to explore the image of women that the society hopes to see at the national level through the research of its cover. And asking what kind of values are being promoted by this journal? Which ones have been seen and what has been overlooked?

​		First of all, who does WOMEN OF CHINA like to choose as the cover character? Through manual coding and statistics on the cover, we found that it is similar to FHM and COSMO. Actors in the entertainment industry have become the first choice for covers. Xu Jinglei, Fan Bingbing, Mei Ting, Jiang Wenli, Sun Li, Tang Wei, Tao Hong, Chen Hong, Yang Lan, etc. appeared on the cover. Although most of the ages of these characters are also concentrated in the 25-44 years old, like FHM and COSMO, WOMEN OF CHINA selects more capable actors than traffic stars.There are obviously more cover characters over the age of 45 than in FHM and COSMO, and the women presented are more mature.
<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/Women%20of%20China%20Cover%20FIgure%20Portrait.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = left>

​		The external image of women displayed on the cover of WOMEN OF CHINA is also significantly different from FHM and COSMO. The cover characters of WOMEN OF CHINA are mainly presented in the form of close shot and medium shot. These two scenes make the audience pay more attention to the upper body of the character instead of the whole body, and the image displayed is more serious, low-key, and calm. In terms of dress, the cover character mainly dresses with a larger wrapping area. And most of them are standing, a few are sitting, and there is almost no posture of lying or kneeling on the ground. The difference in hairstyles is relatively small. The styling of long hair that can clearly show feminine characteristics, updo, and more neutral short hair basically account for about one-third, and there is no obvious bias.

<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/Areas%20of%20Women%20of%20China%20Cover%20%20Figure.png?raw=true"  width = "100%" align = left>

​		Since the WOMEN OF CHINA focuses on showing the style of Chinese women, the cover characters in the past two decades are mainly from mainland China, with a small number of actors, entertainment stars, singers and singers from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan and few are Female politicians abroad.

<img src = "https://github.com/ChenxinZhang/markdownImage/blob/main/AIDM7410/blank.jpg?raw=true"  width = "100%" height = "5px" align = center>
​		In terms of time series, at the beginning of the 21st century, the women on the cover of WOMEN OF CHINA are always placed in the family, with children or husbands next to them. Since 2002, cover women's professions have been almost all literary and artistic figures such as actors, models, singers,hosts and authors. But in 2018, the cover of WOMEN OF CHINA began to be no longer limited to public figures. Outstanding female representatives from all walks of life in mainland China were seen, such as female doctors on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, Dunhuang Research Institute Deans, female scholars, high-speed train attendants, female police officers, female athletes, etc. These professions have never appeared in the male and female business perspectives of FHM and COSMO. This also shows the exploration of WOMEN OF CHINA that wants to show the diversity of women. From commercial value to society, from parents to individuals to the dreams, it shows a change in the value orientation of women.

​		After using artificial intelligence to identify the text on the cover of magazines for 20 years, we studied the frequency of words and found that the keywords on the cover of WOMEN OF CHINA were "entrepreneurship", "story", "Life". These words focus on the realization of the inner value of women, which are quite different from the more outer vocabulary of FHM and COSMO. The words "love", "mind", "happiness", "health", and "growth" are followed, which focus on the construction of women's body and mind, and generally present women's self-love and the realization of self-worth.

**Color: How women were presented**

 left: FHM                    center:  COSMO                   right: Women of China

​		We extracted the 5 colors with the highest proportion in each cover, and set the width according to the color ratio. The length of each color is 224 pixels. Then we sort the color maps according to their RGB mean value (color depth), one row spans one year, arranged from top to bottom, and synthesizes the color maps of the three magazines above. The missing parts of the magazine material are filled with white pictures.

​		We can find that COSMO has the richest and brightest colors, followed by FHM and WOMEN OF CHINA has fewer color changes and a darker overall tone, which is mainly related to magazines. The style and positioning are related. As fashion business magazines, COSMO and FHM need to attract audiences with bright and rich colors and obtain higher commercial value. WOMEN OF CHINA is a national-level journal published by the All-China Women's Federation. Compared with commercial value, it more important is publicity and social value orientation, darker colors will give the audience a sense of trust, making them need to look more professional and stable, so they tend to be conservative in color. At the same time the overall color of WOMEN OF CHINA in the early 21st century and after 2018 is deeper, and the main color is red, which means that the presentation of family and social related topics and characters is mainly red.

​		The color of the magazine will in turn affect the audience's perception of female images. The research of color psychology shows that bright colors can make the audience feel cheap. For example, the trademarks of fast food such as KFC and McDonald’s all choose bright colors, and the bright colors on the cover of business magazines can indeed attract the audience and make the audience perceive that the cost of a magazine is not high. However it may build a "cheap" female image to a large extent for a long time. This will also bring about huge social problems, may increase the crime rate, and make women disrespectful on certain occasions.

**Investigation: Unlimited possibilities for women**

​		We published a questionnaire on April 27, asking women to use three words to describe themselves and men to use three words to describe women. "Optimistic," "interesting," and "kindness", Hu wrote. When asked why she filled in these three words, she said, “On the eve of the May Fourth Youth Day in 2019, I interviewed Jin Chengzhi, conductor of the Shanghai Rainbow Chorus, and asked him to use three words to describe the youth in his eyes. He gave these three words, ‘optimistic’, ‘interesting’, and ‘kindness’. He said that this is what Grandpa expected of him, and he wanted to give these three words to everyone. I like these three words very much. These are what I have and are pursuing as a woman. I don’t want public opinion to oppose the sexes, and I don’t like to hear people around me say, ‘What should a girl do?’ I think everyone on this planet can have unlimited possibilities. Women can be a scientist and love to wear short skirts with suspenders. Don’t be squeezed out because of the differences between us, don’t be cold-hearted because she didn’t integrate into this society, and don’t accuse women of not doing what a woman should do. Be an optimistic, interesting and kind person, regardless of male or female."

​		Cheng, 24, wrote "beautiful", "kind" and "good people" on the questionnaire, saying that even though there are thousands of beautiful people in the world, she feels that she is also beautiful. And "kind" and "good people" are not only her own evaluation, but also her expectations, hoping that she can become a warm-hearted person.

​		In our survey, 160 responses were received, of which 129 were women and 31 were men. From the differences and frequency of words, we can see that the words which were used by women are more abundant.

​		By analyzing women's portraits on three types of magazines and issuing questionnaires, we try to explore the female images constructed by the government, the female images in men's magazines, the female images in women's magazines and the general female individual's self-perceptions.

​		Through the changes of the female images on magazine covers in about the past 20 years, we find that the female images presented in magazines are relatively single. Women in the business magazines are mostly in the entertainment industry, while women in men's magazines usually dress up to meet the aesthetic needs of male viewers and try their best to catch the eyes. Although Women of China has made a variety of choices in terms of its cover women's jobs, including all walks of life, women in life are always more wonderful than what the magazine presents.

 

​		We also see from the changes of magazines in the past 20 years that the attitude of the media as a social tool towards women has changed. Women are no longer a single "mother" or "wife", and are no longer just "beauty" and "sexy stunner" in the eyes of men. Girls can be bold to embrace love and marriage, can be brave to fight for their careers, expand their knowledge. Through the questionnaire survey of individual women, they show a very rich self-cognition, or generous and cheerful, or sensitive and delicate, regardless of the views of others and social requirements.
